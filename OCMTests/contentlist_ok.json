Being on tour, playing on stages all over the world, being admired by fans and cheered on by a huge crowd – but that’s not even all! We made the ultimate list of all the things that rock stars get away with.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>YOU CAN TAKE AS MUCH VACATION AS YOU WANT TO<\/p>\n<p>Most rock stars tour a lot or spend their time off-tour in the studio, but that’s also because it’s what they love doing! Famous musicians have the possibility to take some time off whenever they feel like and can actually spend months on vacation, see exotic places and find inspiration for new material. Spending time at beautiful beaches and relaxing without a care is definitely one of the best perks of being a rock star!<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>IF YOU THROW YOURSELF INTO THE CROWD, THEY WILL ACTUALLY CATCH YOU<\/p>\n<p>What's a rock concert without proper crowd-surfing? Unfortunately, only the people on stage can really be sure to get caught. The fans will be thrilled to touch you and you could surf the wave of hundreds of loving arms that hand you to one another. That’s the real life of a rock star.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT ANYTHING COSTS (BECAUSE YOU ARE PROBABLY RICH)<\/p>\n<p>Life is expensive, especially when it comes to all the shiny, fun things! Most people have to save money to fulfill their dreams, buy a new car or a house, but not a rock star. The irony of it all is that you get loads of stuff for free when you’re rich and famous. Companies want you to wear their clothes, drink their coffee and use their equipment without payment. Sounds pretty sweet, no?<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>"

Everything you wear becomes cool, because you are cool! Brands will send you their stuff for free in the hopes that you’ll wear it and therefore other people buy it. It’s a pretty good deal if you want to take it.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>NOBODY GETS MAD IF YOU BREAK SOMETHING<\/p>\n<p>Ever dreamed of smashing a guitar, TV or smartphone? No problemo when you're famous! You simply buy another one and probably even get applauded for it.

Of course we wouldn't want you to destroy the furniture of whole hotel rooms but when you’re famous, chances are that you can pay for it without even thinking about it.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>"

Intense practice sessions, good diet, critical thinking – winning teams can’t let themselves slip. During off-season, athletes discipline themselves to stay in top physical condition. On the field, they need to have the discipline to stick to team strategies.<\/p>\n<p><br \/> Preparation <\/p>\n<p>Successful sports teams are ready for any challenge. Joe Girardi, the manager of New York Yankees baseball team, once said: “If you think too much, you’ll fail, because the game happens too quickly. The key is preparation and the data has to become instinctual.” His technique is to prepare his team so well that they don’t have to think in the middle of the pitch. The next move just comes to them instinctively.<\/p>\n<p><br \/> Communication <\/p>\n<p>If you watch any good basketball team, you’ll notice they’re constantly talking to each other; helping one another, strategizing about the next move, and shouting praise. And before they get out there, the team leader – usually the coach – needs to communicate the game plan. A clearly communicated plan and pep-talk before the game and on the court is a must.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>Teamwork <\/p>\n<p>Teamwork is a clichéd and overused term, but it’s critical. Leicester City stunned everyone winning the English Premiere League last season, largely riding on the power of their teamwork. While Leicester had talented players, none of them were superstars. There may be hierarchies and specific leaders within a team, but successful teams are built on respect and togetherness. After all, how would Messi shoot if he wasn’t being passed the ball?<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>"

Even your favourite footballer. <br \/> <\/p>\n<p>Honesty <\/p>\n<p>Bill Parcells is a former NFL head coach with teams like the New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys on his resume. He is famous for turning around underperforming teams and he does so with brutal honesty. He once wrote: “You have to tell them the truth about their performance, you have to tell it to them face-to-face, and you to tell it to them over and over again.” He stresses that teams should communicate honestly and in the clearest possible way if they hope to achieve success.<\/p>\n<p><br \/> Attitude <\/p>\n<p>A winning attitude leads to – you guessed it – winning. The Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli knows this. He has said he strives to create “winning habits” in his team. “And you know, winning is contagious,” he said. Attitude is everything, if you’ve got the right mindset, you’re one step closer to the prize!<\/p>\n<p><br \/> Clarity <\/p>\n<p>Every team – sports or otherwise – works best when people know what’s expected of them. One role isn’t necessarily more important than the other; it’s just different. When teams play to their strengths, they win. Like in the latest European Championship, Portugal snatched a surprise victory even though they struggled through the group stages. Their winning secret: well-defined roles. While the team struggled for goals, they were clear about their roles in building an effective defense.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>Good Health<\/p>\n<p>Maintaining good health is key for successful teams. Winning teams take time to recover from injuries and only put those players on the field who are top condition. Sir Alex Ferguson has noted: “Sometimes I could tell a player was injured when he thought he was fine.” As well as being physically in tact, players also need to be healthy from the inside out with good diets and nutrition - after all, fitness starts in the kitchen!<\/p>\n<p><br \/> Love for the team  <\/p>\n<p>This is perhaps the most defining characteristic of winning teams. A team that has fun together, stays together. And a team that stays together, wins together. Welsh football team captain Gareth Bale said: “Playing for Wales is like playing with my friends.” And as friends, they impressed everyone at Euros 2016, putting on a great performance.<\/p>"

                                  "text" : "<p>THE STORIES BEHIND THE MOST ICONIC RAP VIDEOS<\/p>\n<p>There are several things that are really important in rap music. The beat, the rhymes, the melody, the message are all equal parts of what makes a good track, but also the music videos have been getting more and more important as rap superstars are looking for a way to support their music visually. We give you a quick rundown of the most iconic rap videos of the past and their background stories!<\/p>\n<p>JAY-Z – 99 PROBLEMS<\/p>\n<p>99 PROBLEMS is not your ordinary music video, it truly is a piece of art. It was shot around the area in Brooklyn, where JAY-Z grew up and has a lot of auto-biographical references. They recorded the video on black-and-white film which provides an authentic look with visual characteristics that strongly resemble New York street photography. JAY-Z wanted the video to be as raw and authentic as the rest of his masterpiece “The Black Album”, which is now rightfully one of the most influential rap albums of recent music history.<\/p>\n<p>DRAKE – WORST BEHAVIOR<\/p>\n<p>WORST BEHAVIOR is one of Drake’s most famous songs, also thanks to its iconic video that takes us through his father’s home town, Memphis, Tennessee. We go through parking lots of fast food chains, see some classy, old men with their pimped cars and a pretty upset Drake, that keeps asking “Remember?” The local music scene had a huge influence on his music just like his dad, who also plays a part in the video! He is the main pimp, rapping along with Drake’s lyrics, while dancing in the most genuinely cool way we’ve seen in a really long time. The man knows all the right moves. It’s really worth watching the whole 10 minutes but there is also a shorter, edited version.<\/p>\n<p>KANYE WEST – BOUND 2<\/p>\n<p>BOUND 2 is the final track on KANYE WESTs album YEEZUS which also made headlines due to the controversy surrounding the video. The video shows beautiful, almost corny landscapes alongside shots of Kanye riding a motorcycle, wild horses, and soaring eagles. Critics were divided between proclaiming it genius or crap, but let’s be honest, we all know how much Yeezy loves to polarize. It has been parodied on numerous occasions, which shows its great significance and influence on pop culture.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>"

The lyrics and video tell the biographical story of IGGY who rose up from her underclass upbringing to become a world star. She worked hard to be known and raps about the discrimination she was confronted with as a female rapper. Iggy moved to the US shortly before her 16th birthday after telling her parents that she would go on vacation with a friend and ended up staying. “No money, no family, 16 in the middle of Miami” sounds tough but Iggy persevered and is now one of the leading rap stars in the game!<\/p>\n<p>THE WEEKND – CAN'T FEEL MY FACE<\/p>\n<p>Abel Makkonen Tesfaye a.k.a. THE WEEKND released CAN'T FEEL MY FACE in 2015 as part of his famed, second studio album BEAUTY BEHIND THE MADNESS. The simple, yet surprising video reveals Abel’s striking dance moves. THE WEEKND performs in a late night club for a very unimpressed audience but stays focused on his show, even when someone throws a drink at him. In the end he literally catches fire but still keeps on dancing while the crowd finally starts rocking out. Abel’s unusually energetic routine adds a great deal to this weirdly great video.<\/p>\n<p> DRE – FORGOT ABOUT DRE<\/p>\n<p>If you ever wondered what happens if you get into a fight with DR. DRE, this video will give you all the answers. Nobody’s safe from Dre’s revenge when he lets his Pitbull Eminem loose – not even an old lady. In the censored version the explicit rap part of EMINEM was replaced by a TV reporter asking him questions as a witness to the fire he set himself. Once more we see The Real Slim Shady in action and reminds us what an incredible dream team EMINEM and DRE were.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>"

The video is set in a psychiatric ward, a fast food store and a factory which produces numerous EMINEM clones. Apart from that we see EMINEMs wacky side, dressed in a superhero costume and making fun of celebrities. Here’s the part you didn’t know: The TV channels didn't want to play the video uncensored, so there is an even nastier version of it out there! By the way there are lots of parodies of the song and video but Eminem knows that if can you dish it out, you also have to take it.<\/p>\n<p>NELLY – HOT IN HERRE<\/p>\n<p>It’s hard to believe that HOT IN HERRE will celebrate its 15th birthday in a few months! It was the first song ever to win a Grammy Award for Best Male Rap Solo Performance and shows the party life of a rap star that we all dream of: fast cars, hot people and great music. It features cameo appearances by a comedian, as well as famous NBA and NFL players. Did you know NELLY made an alternative video that was shown on MTV Europe? It was shot at the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, which represents Nelly’s hometown.<\/p>\n<p>BEASTIE BOYS – SABOTAGE<\/p>\n<p>This is probably the oldest video on our list, but it is a real classic. It parodies classic crime thrillers made famous in the 70s and hilariously features the three members in bad suits and fake mustaches. SABOTAGE is a fictional police show, introducing the band as made-up actors chasing bad guys in a row of ridiculous stunt scenes. The video was a huge success and still a favorite among fans. For their video anthology they even shot a mock interview of the cast of SABOTAGE.<\/p>"

                                  "text" : "<p>BANDS OF NEW YORK – A BRIEF HISTORY<\/p>\n<p>New York is the city that never sleeps and has a lot of cool things to offer. The city is full of interesting artists, writers, musicians, who work to the beat of this pulsating melting pot of unconventional ideas and inspirational places. New York’s clubs and bars are filled with aspiring musicians, waiting to step into the footsteps of so many bands before them who were discovered on small stages and backyards. We give you a little round up of the coolest bands that were founded and discovered in this exciting city.<\/p>\n<p>YEAH YEAH YEAHS<\/p>\n<p>The indie rock scene wouldn't be complete without the YEAH YEAH YEAHS. Pianist and vocalist Karen O and drummer Brian Chase met at College in Ohio where they lived before going to New York. Karen met guitar and keyboard player Nick Zinner in a New York local bar and formed the YEAH YEAH YEAHS with him in 2000. Brian joined after the first drummer quit. Their arty punk style shook things up in the music industry. Songs like &quot;Maps&quot; defined the sound of the young millennium!<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>BLONDIE<\/p>\n<p>These rock legends caused a great stir in the new wave and punk scene in the 1970s. The moment we hear the band name, a picture of singer Debbie Harry with her blonde trademark hair pops up in our head. Did you know that her appearance really was the reason they called themselves Blondie? The complete line-up of the band changed over the years but gave us memorable hits, such as &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;, &quot;One way of another&quot; and &quot;Call me&quot;. They broke up in 1982 but reformed in 1996 and are still touring and releasing today after more than 40 years in business.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>THE RAPTURE<\/p>\n<p>This trio never was an ordinary rock band. When starting out in 1998 their sound was as unique as their mix of genres from dance, post-punk, disco and electronica, which created songs such as &quot;House of Jealous Lovers&quot;, &quot;How deep is your Love?&quot; and &quot;Pieces of the people we love&quot;. Even the line-up was unusual and changed a lot and eventually led to the former quartet becoming a trio. Even though they never officially announced it, rumor has it that they broke up in 2014, but with this band you can never know for sure.<\/p>\n<p>BEASTIE BOYS<\/p>\n<p>Another group that started out as a quartet but later became a trio. The BEASTIE BOYS formed in 1981, originally as a hardcore punk band! When they released an experimental Hip Hop 12-inch record a year later they found their big love for Hip Hop and Rap Rock. Good for us, their influence on the whole scene cannot be emphasized enough. The Rolling Stone and VH1 ranked them on their lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Unfortunately, they stopped recording in 2012 after gifting the world with eight studio albums and tunes like &quot;(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party)&quot;.<\/p>\n<p>SONIC YOUTH<\/p>\n<p>Finding the perfect band name might take some time. So when guitarist Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon started making music together they called themselves &quot;Male Bonding&quot;, &quot;Red Milk&quot; and &quot;The Arcadians&quot; before finally settling on SONIC YOUTH in 1981. From that day on their characteristic sound came to life and they became huge alternative icons in the 90s. They continued to successfully make records up until 2011 and have influenced a myriad of bands through their impressive oeuvre.<\/p>"

Their eclectic music mixes all kinds of styles and is heavily influenced by a long list of very diverse artists.<\/p>\n<p>THE VELVET UNDERGROUND<\/p>\n<p>THE VELVET UNDERGROUND was a rock band between 1964 and 1973 but they are still legends and it's impossible to imagine the history of rock music without them. Singer and guitarist Lou Reed – who himself became a music legend – formed the band with multi-instrumentalist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Angus Maclise, who was replaced by Maureen Tucker in 1965. They played a big role in New York's art scene as a house band for Andy Warhol's Factory. The eccentric artist also managed them for a short period and his famous banana pop art design is on the cover of their debut album. Unfortunately, huge commercial success never happened during their active years.<\/p>"

Sadly, they also announced, that the band is done and will break up in 2018. So next year is all the more reason to celebrate this fantastic band and take the last chance to see them live!<\/p>"

If the dropping temperatures and slushy sidewalks are already making you want retreat inside to binge watch\n    Netflix then it's time to rethink your favorite snow traditions. Here are 6 activities you must try this winter:\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    1.\n     A snowball fight (extreme edition) \n<\/p>\n<p>\n    Thrive in energetic atmospheres? Love a bit of healthy competition? Having a snowball fight is a great way to keep your inner-child happy and feed your\n    competitive spirit, so why not step it up a level and create an extreme version of the game you already know and love. Build targets out of cardboard that\n    are split up like a dartboard, each section worth a certain amount of points. Hang these from trees or stand them in the ground and split\n    into teams. Create an arsenal of tightly packed snowballs then rocket the snowballs at your competitor’s targets. Keep a tally of the\n    points to see who wins and even throw in a prize for the winning team (maybe hot chocolates or dibs on the first warm bath!).\n<\/p>"

Once the mixture has melted, slowly pour it into a cup of snow, letting it cool for a few minutes. Peel the candy from the snow then enjoy the\n    sugary goodness! If your favorite retreat from the scorching summer heat is a snow cone, don’t wait for July - make a snow cone from real life snow! Make\n    sure you’ve got some fruit concentrate and paper cups (to hold your snow), then pour the juice over the snowballs for a treat that's great all year round!\n    Tip: Make sure it’s clean snow, preferably fresh and just fallen. Don’t touch the yellow snow ;)\n<\/p>"

Creating intricate ice art or    snow sculptures can be quite challenging first go, but we’ve got some pro-tips for your inner-artist to blossom. If you want to form\n    circular ice pieces, put water inside a balloon or in a tupperware container (or ice tray for small pieces) and leave them to freeze overnight. The next\n    day peel off the balloons or pour a little water to get the ice out of the tupperware and then stack or design however you choose. To add color and flair\n    to your ice art, drop a little food dye in with the water in the balloons or tupperware – how about a rainbow igloo?!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    5.\n     Become a street artist \n<\/p>\n<p>\n    Tap into your creative side by letting the snow covered earth be your canvas and write clever messages or graffiti tags in the ice. All\n    you need to do is buy colorful cans of spray paint at your local arts and craft stores to become an up-and-coming snow artist! For more\n    advanced art, try using stencils or cut out shapes or designs in cardboard and paint around it. Make sure to ask permission to graffiti the area first –\n    but the good thing about this type of graffiti is that it can be removed within seconds ;)\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    6. Become a scientist \n<\/p>\n<p>\n    If the snow is piling up around you, and you’ve used all your creative juices, played until your socks were wet and eaten enough snow to give you a brain\n    freeze, there’s one final thing to try. Put 2dl of water on the stove and wait til it boils. When it’s ready, go outside and (super carefully) throw the\n    water it into the freezing cold air – watch in amazement at what happens to the water. This experiment only works in temperatures colder\n    than around -25 celsius, so wait for temperatures to really drop before trying. Also make sure the area is clear of people and pets, it is boiling water\n    after all and some droplets can still burn you or someone else. Can you guess what happens?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n     \n<\/p>\n<p>\n    So don’t let the cooler temperatures force you to become a winter hermit cooped up inside by the fireplace – head outside and enjoy the wonderful snow\n    before it’s too late!\n<\/p>"

Women are slowly claiming their space in even the most traditionally male-dominated fields. That is also the case for music genres like Hip Hop and Rap, traditionally “tough” to prove to yourself within. Even though women are not new to the hip hop scene, female rappers were usually outcasts if you take aside a few stand-alone heroines, who paved the way for the female rap super stars that dominate the scene today. Time to take a look and find out what is the secret to their fame and how that changes things for everyone.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>M.I.A.<\/p>\n<p>Mathangi &quot;Maya&quot; Arulpragasam better known as M.I.A is anything but a newcomer. Her stage name (short for: Missing in Action) already indicates that she is an artist who has a lot to say and who is not afraid to take a stand. The political and social issues she cares about are an important part of her music as well as her visual art. She's a megastar way beyond the hip hop and rap scene and her audience often is as mixed as the music she samples on her tracks. With her fifth studio album “AIM” she manifested herself as more than an artist and a musician, but an outspoken advocate for the things she believes in and fuel her creativity.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>"

Nicki is taking the style and fashion sense that's always been an essential part of the hip hop scene to a totally new level.

So at the sweet age of 16 she packed her bags and moved to the United States to make her dream come true. Her debut studio album &quot;The new Classic&quot; was a sensation and made her the first non-American female rapper to reach No. 1 on the R&amp;B\/Hip-Hop Charts. Fun fact: Even though she's from Australia she raps with a thick American accent ever since she first got involved in the Southern hip hop scene.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>ANGEL HAZE<\/p>\n<p>Originally from Detroit, Michigan, Raeen Roes Wilson grew up in a community that forbid her to wear jewelry, date, listen to music or talk to outsiders. When she was 16 her family moved to New York and she found her place in the local hip hop scene. From that time on nobody could stop her or order her to be quiet. Her debut album &quot;Dirty Gold&quot; was released in 2013 and last year she self-released her internet-album &quot;Back to the Woods&quot;. The songs often focus on topics that concern young women like body image and gender equality. She's an LGBTQ rights activist and speaks openly about gender identity and queerness. Something that her male counterparty could definitely pick up from her!<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>"

Sometimes it's hard to keep up with all the releases but don’t worry – we kept an overview so you can sit back, relax, and put on our list of great albums that completely fell under the radar in 2016.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>THE 1975 - I LIKE IT WHEN YOU SLEEP, FOR YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL YET SO UNAWARE OF IT<\/p>\n<p>THE 1975 deserve an award for the album title of the year! Seriously, can it get more romantic than that? The quartet from England knows how to put us into a great mood. They mix Alternative Indie Rock with Pop and sound like they've always been a part of the indie rock scene, even though ILIWYSFYASBYSUOI (even the shortcut of this title is long) is only their second release. If you've missed it so far, give it a listen right now!<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>JAMES BLAKE - THE COLOUR IN ANYTHING<\/p>\n<p>Another talent from the island. Singer, songwriter and producer JAMES BLAKE from London was at the forefront of the dubstep movement a couple of years ago. You can still hear parts of it as influence on songs of THE COLOUR IN ANYTHING, even though he mixes all kinds of styles. R&amp;B meets electronic pop with his soulful voice bringing lots of emotions into play. The perfect tunes for everyone who loves honest, emotional music that feels truly personal. One of our favorite tracks to really dive into James Blake’s music is “I Need A Forest Fire”.<\/p>"

The British soul musician started out as a session guitarist and supported big stars on tour. Now he is back with his second solo album, that quickly became No. 1 in his home country. We don't get why it wasn't on top of the charts around the world! Especially the single &quot;Black Man in A White World&quot; can't be more relevant in 2016.

Double the talent often equals double the fun! We tell you what collaborations have been the most fruitful in 2016 – let’s hope these teams weren't just a once in a lifetime occurrence.<\/p>\n<p>RIHANNA (FEAT. DRAKE) - WORK<\/p>\n<p>We love everything Riri does, guilty as charged! Of course her collaboration with cutie DRAKE can't be missed on any hot list this year. WORK is a great reggae-pop song that incorporates her roots in Dancehall. Once again RIHANNA demonstrates the capacity of her voice that fits perfectly to DRAKE'S R&amp;B vocals. A match made in heaven, which can be also seen in the two(!) videos they shot for the song. These two have known each other for years and it's not the first time they're collaborating, which makes us ask: What's the current status? Is it really just work?<\/p>\n<p>DESIIGNER (FEAT. KANYE WEST) - TIIMMY TURNER (REMIX) <\/p>\n<p>At only 19 years old Sidnes Royel Selby III a.k.a. DESIIGNER has already made a name for himself. The New Yorker hip hop artist presents us a Trap, Horrorcore song that sticks. The official remix features production and voice from KANYE. Did you know that the title is a reference to a cartoon character? Timmy Turner from &quot;The Fairly Odd Parents&quot; has fairy godparents that grant him every wish. Unfortunately, these wishes turn out to have strange, unpredictable side effects Timmy has to deal with.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>"

Good for us, because we can't get enough of her talents and her unique voice. It spans a stunning four octaves! For LET ME LOVE YOU she went into the studio with no other than mega star LIL WAYNE. Fans were smitten by the result: cool hip-hop beats with a laid back R&amp;B melody, stuttered vocals in the chorus and LIL WAYNE and ARIANA at their absolute best!<\/p>\n<p>PUSHA (FEAT. JAY Z) - DRUG DEALERS ANONYMOUS<\/p>\n<p>The 39-year-old American rapper is not only a hip hop artist but also president of Kanye Wests record company. He started his career as part of a duo, together with his brother, until they both decided that it was time to follow their own path. For DRUG DEALERS ANONYMOUS superstar JAY Z came on board. The hip hop track is great to chill, with a slow-paced beat and a homey feeling to it. The two super stars show us how great they can be when they join forces!<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>"

This song is about his faith and he sings about his love for god. The rap from CHANCE THE RAPPER brings the Hip Hop back into this laid back gospel track. For us, this is one of the most original tracks of this year.<\/p>\n<p>JAMES BLAKE (FEAT. BON IVER) - I NEED A FOREST FIRE<\/p>\n<p>One of the most original songs this year and nobody seems to have noticed. Why? JAMES BLAKE and BON IVER created an amazing track that tears down the barriers between Folk, Electronic and Gospel. The great teamwork between the British singer-songwriter and the American indie folk band was released on JAMES BLAKE album &quot;The Colour in Anything&quot;. We couldn't get &quot;I need a forest fire&quot; out of our heads for weeks, which goes to show that a collab between those two was long overdue.<\/p>\n<p>KANYE WEST (FEAT. KENDRICK LAMAR) - NO MORE PARTIES IN L.A.<\/p>\n<p>We know: KANYE again? Well, he was a busy bee this year and the list wouldn't be complete without NO MORE PARTIES IN L.A. In the second half he raps &quot;the writer's block is over&quot;, doesn't look like writer’s block to us! This time Kanye brought on KENDRICK LAMAR to support him on this track. The lyrics are mocking the lifestyle of Hollywood’s rich people. It's their first collaboration and hopefully not their last.<\/p>"
